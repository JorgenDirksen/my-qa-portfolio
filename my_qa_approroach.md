# My QA Philosophy: From Practice to Structure
        
        ## Core Principle
        Software should work as the user expects. My job is to be that first, most attentive user.
        
        ## How I Test
        1.  **Understand:** What is this feature's purpose?
        2.  **Explore:** Use it in all possible ways, like a real user.
        3.  **Analyze:** If something breaks or feels wrong, I dig deep to find the root cause.
        4.  **Communicate:** I describe the problem clearly so developers can fix it efficiently.
        
        ## Current Focus
        Structuring this practical mindset into industry-standard practices (test cases, bug reports, automation).
