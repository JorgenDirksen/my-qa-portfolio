# George QA Engineering Journey
** QA Engineer with  Manual Testing experience | Transitioning to Automation QA **

## Current Goal 
Transition from **Manual QA** to **Automation QA Engineer** by expanding my technical stack while leveraging existing testing expertise

## What I'm Actively Learning
- **Python** for test automation(basic: variables, conditions, loops)
- **Selenium WebDriver** for UI automation
- **Postman** for API testing(GET/POST request, collections)
- **Git & GitHub** for version control
- **Pytest** for test organisation

## My Testing Toolkit
### Manual Testing Experties
